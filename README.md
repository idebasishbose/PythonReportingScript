# Python Reporting Script
Create a Python script in a single file that will traverse the filesystem finding the largest files in a path.
# Tasks
1. Create a new Github repository with a README and a single python file.

2. Make your Python script accept an argument to traverse any path (don't hardcode the path!)

3. Use different options in the script for reporting, like:

    a. No more than 20 files

    b. Files larger  than a specific size in megabytes

4. Complete the Demo project in GitHub with a README.md that describes what you did.

5. Create a Demo Video and reference it in your GitHub Project.

# Bonus
Try adding options to your script like a help menu, or matching specific names or suffixes. For example finding files that end in .mp3
